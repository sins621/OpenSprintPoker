# Cursor Rules

## Code Style
- Never leave comments in files. Remove all comments from code, including:
  - Single-line comments (// and #)
  - Multi-line comments (/* */ and """ """)
  - Inline comments
  - TODO comments
  - Documentation comments that are not part of the code structure (e.g., JSDoc, docstrings)
